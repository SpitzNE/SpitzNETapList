TAP LIST EDITING INSTRUCTIONS
==============================
- All edits made to any text on the tap list will be done within the "index.html" file
- All edits to images or background images will be done within the "style.css" file
- Simply click the file needed on the left-hand side, and edit the file by clicking "edit" in the top right of the code

==============================
UPDATING BEVERAGES
==============================
- To change a current beverage to a new one on the tap list:
  1) Open "index.html"
  2) All text that will show up on the physical webpage will appear in white colored font, so make sure you are only editing the white text.
  3) Delete the white text containing the beverage you are replacing.
  4) Add the new beverage in the space between "<p>" and "</p>", where you had deleted the original beverage text. Make sure to include ABV and Price if applicable!
  5) In the top right of the code, click "commit changes" to save the edit and it will automatically update the tap list online! Well done!


- To cross a beer off on the tap list indicating it is sold out:
  1) Open "index.html"
  2) Find the text containing the beverage you would like to cross-out
  3) Find the "<p>" that comes directly before the beer you're changing
  4) Edit "<p>" to: <p class="soldout">

    -) For example, under the "TapBeers" in "index.html", lets change the Pistachio Cream Ale. 
    -) You would locate the text: "<p>Indeed - Pistachio Cream Ale - 5.5% - $7</p>"
    -) You would change it to: "<p class="soldout">Indeed - Pistachio Cream Ale - 5.5% - $7</p>"
    -) Dont forget to edit "<p class="soldout">" back to "<p>" once the beverage makes its return!

==============================
UPDATING BACKGROUND PHOTO
==============================
- To change the background photo(s) for the tap list:
  1) first, save the image(s) you want to put into the tap list to the desktop or in downloads
  2) second, scroll to the top of this page, and click on "SpitzNETapList" in the top left of the screen
  3) select "add files", then "upload files"
  4) you can then navigate to wherever you saved the image, and drag and drop it into the box indicated for uploading the file, then click upload file(s) in the top right.
  5) It makes it much easier if you then edit the name of the image to something easy to remember and type
  6) click on "style.css" file on the left-hand side and click "edit"
  7) Towards the top of the code, there is a line saying "background-image:" in the parenthesis after "url", and within the quotation marks, simply type the name that you named the photo file. Make sure to include .jpg or .png etc. depending on the file type.
  8) Click "commit changes" in the top right, and you are all set! If you are replacing an image that is already there, simply find the corresponding file name in style.css, and delete and replace with the new photo name. Well done!
